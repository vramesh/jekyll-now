The MIT Sloan School of Management recently invited me to speak to Executive MBA students about my experience as a startup founder. I had the opportunity to discuss everything ranging from how I met my co-founders to how we pivoted our way to the current iteration of the business. The big question on most students’ minds was how to connect with and recruit engineers as co-founders for their business ventures. 

Based on that conversation, I’ve attempted to distill, from my experience as an engineering student, and as a co-founder, a few key points for non-technical founders on how to find, interest, and impress potential engineering co-founders:

1. Strategically build your network of engineers
 - Don't spend too much time at career fair booths, can't form personal relationship with best engineers
 - Find out from everyone who the top 3 people they know are
 - Organize private dinners with top engineering talent and get to know them
 - Ask them about their side projects
2. Find opportunities to collaborate on side-projects (with no potential financial upside)
 - Gives you a chance to work with different people and see how you get along
 - View and treat your (potential) engineering co-founder as an equal partner
 - All too often, MBA students think tech co-founder = code monkey
 - These requests are treated as running jokes within engineering depts
 - Make it clear, as the non-technical co-founder, what value you bring to the table (must be more than just having the idea)
3. Take initiative and build a prototype by yourself first
 - Can you get your prototype etc done w/ simpler means? 
 - There’s a lot you can do without a technical co-founder: wire frame, user research, customer pre-orders
 - Try to work with a free lance consultant
4. Create and promote a culture of engineering leadership 
 - Code, product, engineering architecture, and business model are inseparable	
 - Respect an engineer’s different perspective and encourage them to participate in the business itself, take their input on product, and expose them to customers. 
 - Take the time to educate your potential co-founder about the problem domain
 - Do you know enough about the domain yourself to help give your co-founder solid intuition?
