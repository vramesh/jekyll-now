The MIT Sloan School of Management recently invited me to speak to Executive MBA students about my experience as a startup founder. I had the opportunity to discuss everything ranging from how I met my co-founders to how we pivoted our way to the current iteration of the business. The big question on most students’ minds was how to connect with and recruit engineers as co-founders for their business ventures. 

Based on that conversation, I’ve attempted to distill, from my experience as an engineering student, and as a co-founder, a few key points for non-technical founders on how to find, interest, and impress potential engineering co-founders:

Strategically build your network of engineers
Easy for us at MIT (since we had network, but built from scratch at Waterloo)
Don't spend too much time at career fair booths, can't form personal relationship with best engineers
Find out from everyone who the top 3 people they know are
Organize private dinners with top engineering talent and get to know them
Ask them about their side projects
Make time to consistently visit the schools (like we did for Waterloo)
Find opportunities to collaborate on side-projects (with no potential financial upside)
Gives you a chance to work with different people and see how you get along
View and treat your (potential) engineering co-founder as an equal partner
All too often, MBA students think tech co-founder = code monkey
These requests are treated as running jokes within engineering depts
Make it clear, as the non-technical co-founder, what value you bring to the table (must be more than just having the idea)
Take initiative and build a prototype by yourself first
Can you get your prototype etc done w/ simpler means? 
There’s a lot you can do without a technical co-founder: wire frame, user research, customer pre-orders
Try to work with a free lance consultant
Create and promote a culture of engineering leadership 
Code, product, engineering architecture, and business model are inseparable	
Respect an engineer’s different perspective and encourage them to participate in the business itself, take their input on product, and expose them to customers. 
Take the time to educate your potential co-founder about the problem domain
Do you know enough about the domain yourself to help give your co-founder solid intuition?
